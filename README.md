# Automated-Prediction-of-Avalanches
Snow avalanchesÂ are a natural hazard that can cause danger to human lives. This threat can
be reduced by accurate prediction of the danger level. Development of mathematical models
based on past data and present conditions can help in improving the accuracy of prediction.
Major hurdle in developing reliable models is the lack of sufficient and trustworthy data. This
issue has been resolved to a great extent by WSL Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research,
Switzerland by collecting 20 years of data in the context of avalanche forecasting. This data
set has been further refined with quality control by experts.
The challenge now is to develop models that can accurately predict hazardous events and
issue warning to save precious human lives.



The model here can be used to predict avalanche Danger levels , don't forget to add a csv source file
